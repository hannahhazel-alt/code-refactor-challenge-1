## Description

A marketing company hired me to change their code to make the website more accessible and to clean up the code. My motivation for this project was to meet the criteria of the client, which was to make the code cleaner than before and to make the website more accessible. This was achieved by putting alt text with the images, making sure that HTML flowed in semantic order with relevant headings and that CSS wasn't repeated unnecessarily. I buildt this project because it's important that the HTML and CSS make sense when other dev's work on the code in future, I also wanted to make sure that the website is accessible to others who make be visually impaired etc. which now solves the problem that the client was having beforehand. During this project I learnt how to make HTML flow better with following semantics and how to clean up CSS styling by grouping blocks together. I think this project stands out from the rest because it is clean, and accessible to others which other SEO marketing websites might lack.
